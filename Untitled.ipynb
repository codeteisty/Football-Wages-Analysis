    "Salaries of sportsmen were always an interesting topic for public and I'm not an exception. Thus, I decided to analyse a dataset that contains information about salaries of football players from top 6 European leagues (the rating is based on the performance of teams in such tournaments as Champions league and Europa league). While conducting my research, I will use several libraries like Seaborn or Plotly to display graphs and fascinating findings.\n",
